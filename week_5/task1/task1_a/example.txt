What makes me a good Demoman?

If I were a bad Demoman, I wouldn't be sittin' here, discussin' it with you now would I?

Let's do it!
Not one of ya's gonna' survive this.

One crossed wire, one wayward pinch of potassium chlorate, one errant twitch... and kablooie!

I got a manky eye. I'm a black, Scottish cyclops.

They've got more f-[long censored]-s than they've got the likes of me.

So....

...T'all you fine dandies so proud, so cocksure.

Prancin' aboot with your heads full of eyeballs! Come and get me I say! I'll be waiting on ya with a whiff of the 'ol brimstone. I'm a grim bloody fable... with an unhappy bloody end!

Oh, they're going to have to glue you back together... in hell!
